<h3 align="center">CRUD Java :pencil:</h3>

### :writing_hand: About
In this application, I and [@victorcstv](https://github.com/victorcstv) just created a simple CRUD who is what we've studied so far at JAVA.

### Features

- **`CREATE`**: You can fill the labels and add the item in a list by clicking in **ADICIONAR**.

- **`READ`**: When you click a item on the list, you can read all the informations about him.

- **`REMOVE`**: You can remove any list item when you select him and click in **REMOVER**.

- **`UPDATE`**: You can change the informations about a item when you click him and change the labels and last you need to click in **ALTERAR**.
